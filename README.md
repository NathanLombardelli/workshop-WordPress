## Installation

### Requirements

To use WordPress, you must to install a HTTP server, Apache or Nginx.

You also need to have PHP and MySQL (or MariaDB) & a Database manager (Workbench, phpMyAdmin...).

Once you have launch your environment (a server with PHP & MySQL), you're ready to start. 

> ðŸ‘‰ NB: in this repo, you have already a [docker environment](#the-docker-environment) ready, feel free to use it. 

### WordPress files

The WordPress files can be downloaded on the official website here : https://wordpress.org/download/

You run these in your env & the WordPress will start. 

For this workshop, we've already downloaded it for you in `src/public`.  

### Link the database

The first thing to do is to create an empty database in your DB manager. Git it a name. 

The next step is to go the file ``wp-config.php` & write the correct info of your DB to be able to link it with WorkPress.  

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'designo');

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'password' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'mysql' );

```

> ðŸ‘‰ To allow plugins to be installed on Linux, you may write the following line in your `wp-config.php` file : `define('FS_METHOD','direct');`
